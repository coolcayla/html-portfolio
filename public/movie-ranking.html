<hr />
<h3>Clue</h3>
<p>It's spooky, it's silly, it's sexy and so much fun.</p>
<h3>To Live & Die in L.A.</h3>
<p>1980's action and sassy cop movie. Miami Vice eatcha 'art out <3</p>
<h3>Jackie Brown</h3>
<p>Funky and comfy. A thrilling crime story that keeps up with the best, but with a sweet, mundane musk.</p>
